							About Me
						</h4>
						<p class="about-me">
							I have held various roles over the years, doing a wide variety of work. Once the pandemic
							hit at the begining of this year, I felt it was time to learn a new skill and put myself on
							the path to a succesful career in a role I enjoy. I decided to do my studying through the
							Code Institute, and gain a diploma in Full Stack web development.
							<br>
							<br>
              I started to gain an intrest in web development from my time as a project co-ordinator. Leading the team of developers in solving technical bugs in the system, or new features, I was always keen to learn what went wrong, as well as how it went wrong. This gave me a basic understanding of HTML and CSS as well as how a back end system works and links together.
							<br>
							<br>
              After taking some time out of my career for myself, and finding myself with more spare time on my hands due to the pandemic, I wanted to come out of it with a new skill set and focus in my life. I feel now I am ready to start this new career in web development, and would greatly appreciate the opportunity.

							My Interests
						</h4>
						<p class="about-me">
							Not content with sitting around wasting my free time, I enjoy
							traveling and visiting new towns and cities, whether this be a
							day out in the UK or going further afield, visiting cities
							abroad. The part I enjoy most is exploring, taking pictures and
							tasting the local food a place has to offer.
							<br />
							<br />
                I like to listen to the radio, mainly Radio 2, with
                disappointing performances at answering popmaster. I also enjoy
                listening to podcasts such as the Infinite Monkey Cage, This
                Life Scientific and the Frank Skinner Show as well as anything
                else interesting and insightful. I enjoy to read, with my
                favourite reads being the works of Nick Hornby, Danny Wallace
                and Dan Brown for fiction works, and any book about astronomy
                and how the universe works for non-fiction.
							<br />
							<br />
                I like to keep active through running, walking in the
                countryside, going to the gym and cycling (kind of). When it
                comes to watching TV, like my books, I enjoy any documentary on
                astronomy and space, such as The Sky At Night, and the Wonders
                series with Brian Cox. If not about space, I like to watch
                travel shows like ...With Simon Reeve and cooking shows to
                improve my culinary skills at home or a quiz show to test my
                general knowledge.
